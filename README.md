# Project-1

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement. Employess can select the type of reimbursements Lodging, Travel, Food, or Other.

The back-end system connects to a MariaDB database. Hibernate is utilized to perform database operations. The middle tier uses Javalin technology. The front-end view uses vanilla JavaScript that uses Fetch to call server-side components.
